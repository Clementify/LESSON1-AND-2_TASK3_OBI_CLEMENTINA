            <p>
                Read on to learn step by step on how to produce some cleaning
                agents
            </p>
            <p>
                I will guide you on how to produce <em> Bleach</em>,
                <em>Liguid soap</em> and <em>Powdered Detergent</em>
            </p>

                <h2>Bleach Production</h2>
                <p>
                    Ingridients needed for bleach production are as follows
                    <strong>Caustic soda</strong> <strong>water</strong>
                    <strong>Soda ash</strong> and <strong>Chlorine</strong>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Before you embark on the production journey make sure you
                    have your saety at heart by buying
                    <em>Nose Mask</em>and <em>Hand Glove</em>
                </p>
                <h3>Step 1</h3>
                <p>
                    Dissolve Chlorine in 4 Littres of water and leave for 48
                    hours. Then dissolve soda ash for atleast 24 hours.
                </p>
                <h3>Step 2</h3>
                <p>
                    Mix the two mixtures together and filter.The clear solution

                <h2>Liquid Soap Production</h2>
                <p>
                    These ingredients are for large-scale production of liquid
                    soaps like Morning Fresh; if you intend to make liquid soap
                    at home, kindly refer to procedure 1. 700 kg of water, 70 kg
                    of sulfuric acid, Sodium carbonate (washing soda), 1 kg of
                    triethanolamine, 55 kg of texapon, 55 grams of glycerine, 1
                    kg of trisodium phosphate, 4 grams of soap colouring, 1 kg
                    soap preservative, Perfume Salt
                </p>
                <h2>Step1</h2>
                <p>
                    Install a funnel at the bottom of a big,
                    high-temperature-resistant container or pot to filter and
                    drain the precipitated liquid soap contaminants. Install a
                    second faucet 17 cm from the pot's base for subsequent use
                    in filling the liquid soap. Put 700 kg of water in the pot.
                    Add sodium phosphate to the water and mix the ingredients in
                    a single direction. Add the sulfonic acid gradually while
                    continuing to stir in the same direction as previously to
                    prevent the formation of lather that would ruin the liquid
                    soap and alter the outcomes of the interactions between the
                    constituent ingredients.
                </p>
                <h3>Step2</h3>
                <p>
                    After ensuring the sulfonic acid is dissolved, continue
                    stirring in one direction while adding sodium carbonate. Add
                    triethanolamine until the soap ingredients are neutralised,
                    and the reaction is complete. Leave the mixture alone until
                    its temperature, which must have increased due to chemical
                    interaction, has cooled. Now place the mixture in a big
                    plastic container. Then, include the 55 kg of texapon, 10 kg
                    of salt, and 70 litres of water with a long wooden stick.
                </p>
                <h3>Step3</h3>
                <p>
                    Now whisk in 1 kg of soap preservative in the same
                    direction. After ensuring that all the ingredients are
                    homogenous, add glycerine, colourant, and fragrance until
                    all the liquid soap-making procedures have been finished.
                    Store your morning fresh liquid soap in plastic bottles.

                <h2>Powdered Detergent Production</h2>
                <p>
                    Each company has its detergent powder making formula.
                    Depending on your target market demographic, you have to
                    craft a unique formula. You can source the needed
                    manufacturing technology from several researchers and
                    schools. To help you, we’ve put together this reference for
                    your basic formula and ingredients percentage.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Ingredients 85% active LAB acid slurry Sodium carbonate
                    (soda ash) Sodium metasilicate Alkaline sodium silicate
                    Sodium bicarbonate Sodium Sulphate (anhydrous) Sodium
                    tripolyphosphate Sodium carboxymethyl cellulose
                    Phthalocyanine blue color or oil-soluble yellow color
                    Optical whitener Perfume Water
                </p>
                <h3>Step 1</h3>
                <p>
                    Using soda ash, neutralize the acid slurry. Then, so that
                    the reaction is completed, keep the mixture for about an
                    hour.
                </p>
                <h3>Step2</h3>
                <p>
                    Mix all the other ingredients like Colours, Glauber’s salt,
                    CMC, STEP, Perfume, TSP, and many others. Once done,
                    continuously mix everything so that your ingredients blend
                    to the neutralized acid slurry.
                </p>

                <h3>Step 3</h3>
                <p>
                    Afterward, dry the mixture. Lastly, pack your finished
                    product. Make sure to use proper packing.
